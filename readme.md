# PlanAmity - A project planner in Java

### What is this?

This is the codebase for an old project of mine - a project-planning application, built using JavaFX.

#### <span style="color: red">This project has been abandoned, but the code is available for reference.</span>

## How to run

This app was left in a relatively ugly state, but it it can be compiled and run if you're really in interested in how far I got (which I don't recommend).

#### JavaFX 9+ is required.

If you're using IntelliJ IDEA, it's easy:

1. Clone the project
2. Import the project folder into IDEA
3. Compile and run Main.java (located in ./src/application)

In any other IDE:

-  Compile and run Main.java (located in ./src/application)
